Frontend Project - Jhed Lavente

Runs on CSS and HTML as a showcase of frontend capability 
Unfortunately as SCSS is a preprocessor i was not able to showcase that in this project. I hope CSS is enough 

Since this is pure HTML and CSS it should be pretty straightforward how this project can be viewed.
If there are any questions please do not hesitate to email me at Jhedlavente@gmail.com
